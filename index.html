                        In the time intervals with significant number of meteorite incidents, which regions are most
                        affected and what is the mean meteorite mass in them?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The line plot allows the scrutiny of occurrences as the years passed. During its implementation,
                        it was noticed that 288 instances out of the 45,716 contained in the data set lacked the year
                        of occurrence. By analysing it, one can see that the number of meteorites significantly
                        increased from 1970 onwards. This does not mean that there were very few meteorites previously,
                        but more likely that such events are observed, registered and studied now more than ever. There
                        are incidents dating as far back as 860 CE, but such old instances are few and far between.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conjunction with this line plot, the count and average mass choropleth maps allow the
                        inspection of which regions registered the most meteorite landings, and which saw the biggest
                        average mass. These maps were obtained by performing a reverse geocoding of the coordinates
                        originally present in this data set using
                        <a class="uk-link" href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/">MapBox's API</a>. It is worth
                        mentioning that this API failed to return the country of 14,962 instances, which is around a
                        third of the data set instances. To visualize all meteorite landings, another map plot with
                        circle marks is available by clicking on
                        <a class="uk-link" href="./occurrencesMap.html">Occurrences Map</a>.

                    <p>
                        In terms of number of occurrences, Antarctica tops the ranking with 20,676 instances. However,
                        as it can be seen on the average mass choropleth, Greenland and Namibia seem to have the biggest
                        average mass by far. Interestingly enough, Greenland and Namibia only have 4 and 17 occurrences
                        respectively, which is significantly less than Antarctica. Indeed, Greenland and Namibia have
                        extreme outliers in terms of mass. They can be filtered out by adjusting the mass range selector
                        to cover from 0 up to the 99th percentile in terms of mass. In doing so, other countries take
                        the lead, such as Colombia, Belarus, and Turkmenistan.

                        The average mass of the meteorites that landed in these countries and regions can be found by
                        passing the mouse over them on the choropleth maps. The ability to select time ranges on the
                        line chart would be ideal; however, due to the constraints related to this activity,
                        implementing this was not feasible in a timely manner, and could be a pertinent future
                        improvement to this dashboard.

                    <p>
                        This question can be answered by looking at the bar plot at the bottom right corner of the
                        dashboard. It shows how many meteorites of each class are described in this data set. By
                        clicking on one or many bars, the visualizations are dynamically filtered to consider only the
                        selected classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this bar plot, one can see that the ten most frequent classes are:

                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                        Similarly to what was seen in the choropleth maps, analysing the mean mass of the meteorite
                        landings of any given class is as simple as passing the mouse through the respective bar.

                        Are there any geographic or temporal differences between the meteorite classes that fell on
                        Earth?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With the current visualization techniques and lower/upper bounds of the scales, it seems that
                        there are no significant changes in geographic terms. Antarctica seems to have plenty of
                        occurrences of the most frequent meteorite classes. Moreover, there are no significant
                        differences in terms of temporal distribution: all the most frequent classes saw a rise in the
                        number of registered incidents from 1970 onwards, with the only difference being in the number
                        of incidents, as seen in the bar plot.

                        Looking in hindsight, it seems that the global filtering of outliers performed outside this
                        JavaScript application did not contemplate the filtered maps. A better alternative would be to
                        automatically perform outlier filtering using a Z-Score-based approach in the JavaScript
                        application itself and automatically. This serves as meaningful feedback for any prospective
                        endeavors involving visualization with <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.

                        Which is the predominant class of meteorites of type Fell, when did they occur the most and
                        where they can be most frequently observed?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                       This question is interesting because the Fell class (i.e., those incidents that were observed as
                       they happened instead of just finding the meteorite afterwards) are a small class, amounting to
                       just 1,107 instances. The Found class, conversely, contains 44,609 entries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the produced dashboard, the types of meteorite incidents can be filtered by using the
                        checkboxes. By changing their state, all visualizations are dynamically updated accordingly. By
                        selecting only Fell incidents, one can see how the distributions are significantly different.
                        To begin with, no more than 20 Fell observations were registered in the same year. Moreover, no
                        Fell incidents were registered in Antarctica, which means that all meteorite incidents there
                        were registered post-impact. Now, the leading countries in terms of this type of landings are
                        the United States, India, China, and Russia.

                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                        Lastly, the line plot allows the inspection of when this type of incident happened the most, and
                        the bar plot and mass slider allow additional filtering to see how each meteorite class is
                        distributed in terms of mass, geographical location, and time.

                        How the Fell and Found meteorites differ in geographic and temporal terms?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The previous question helps to answer this one. As previously mentioned, this data set is very
                        unbalanced in terms of Fell/Found occurrences. In addition to this fact, the geographical
                        distribution of these types of meteorite landings significantly differ.
                    </p>
                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-bottom">
                        Overall, only the distribution of Fell and Found incidents in terms of time can be considered
                        similar. The numbers and variations are naturally higher on the predominant class, but all of
                        began to be more frequently registered around the same time mentioned before (from year 1970
                        onwards).
